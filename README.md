# LK MGIMO Patch

This small plugin fixes sever issues I personally have with beloved MGIMO student office web page.

### This includes but is not limited to:

* Disable abysmally slow scroll bar
* Fix overlapping columns with unreadable text
* Reverse Antiplagiat file table to display the latest entries on top
* Move Antiplagiat entry action buttons to the top
* Prettify Antiplagiat copy percentage
